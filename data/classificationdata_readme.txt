Here is how the classificationdata.csv document works:
The vectors column always contains the number of vectors that are generated by doc2vec
The classifier column contains the classifier that NLP will use.
    Supported classifiers include: GaussianNB, KNeighborsClassifier, SVC, and LogisticRegression

For each classifier:
    KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = misc1)
    LogisticRegression(C = misc1)
    GaussianNB(var_smoothing = misc1)
    SVC(kernel = misc1, C = misc2, gamma/degree = misc3)
